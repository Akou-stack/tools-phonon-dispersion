    <p>This tool allows to visualize the phonon dispersion calculated with an external software and display graphically
    the eigenstates, i.e., the (normal modes) of the lattice vibrations.</p>

    <p>With this tool, you can:</p>

    <ul>
        <li>visualize the phonon dispersion along a path in the Brillouin Zone
        <li>visualize interactively a supercell of the crystal structure, where atoms oscillate according to the
        phonon normal modes of a point selected on the phonon dispersion plot</li>
        <li>show the vectors of oscillation, and change the oscillation speed and amplitude</li>
    </ul>

    <p>The tools is heavily based <a href="http://henriquemiranda.github.io/phononwebsite/">phonon visualizer</a> by
    Henrique Miranda, and it wraps it inside the Materials Cloud Docker-based environment via
    the <a href="https://github.com/materialscloud-org/tools-barebone">tools-barebone</a> framework.</p>

    <p>This tool already provides a few examples to select from. The list of examples will be increased over time.</p>
